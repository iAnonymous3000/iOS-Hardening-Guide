## Introduction
Welcome to the Ultimate iOS Hardening Guide! This guide is designed to enhance the security and privacy of iPhones and iPads for users at all levels, from beginners to advanced. We explore and explain Apple's security features, their limitations, and provide alternative solutions for robust privacy and security within the Apple ecosystem.

## Passcodes and Encryption
- **Strong Passcode**: Opt for at least a 6-digit passcode, or better yet, an alphanumeric one for higher security.
- **Biometric Security**: Use Face ID or Touch ID with an understanding of the legal and privacy implications.
- **Advanced Options**: Turn off 'Simple Passcode' for more complex passcode options.
- **Data Protection**: Always enable data protection and keychain protection in your settings.

## Two-Factor Authentication
Two-factor authentication adds a critical layer of security. It combines something you know (your password) and something you have (your device). Activate it under `Settings → [Your name] → Password & Security → Two-factor authentication`.

## Optimizing Tracking and Location Services
Privacy is key. Regularly check `Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking` and toggle off 'Allow Apps to Request to Track'. Manage app permissions for location access under `Settings → Location Services`.

## Biometric ID Considerations and Legal Implications
Biometrics like Touch ID and Face ID are convenient but have legal implications. In some areas, using a passcode offers more legal protection. Consider scenarios where biometrics might be less secure than a passcode.

## Enhancing Lock Screen Security
Your lock screen can be a vulnerability. Limit accessible features from `Settings → Touch ID/Face ID & Passcode`. This helps protect personal information even when your phone is locked.

## Managing App Permissions
Review app permissions regularly in your device settings, paying special attention to access to the microphone, camera, and location services.

## Disabling Tracking and Ad Tracking
To limit ad tracking, navigate to `Settings → Privacy & Security → Apple Advertising` and disable 'Personalized Ads'.

## Using VPN and Firewall for Enhanced Security
Protect against Wi-Fi hacking and mask your IP address with a reliable VPN. This is crucial for maintaining privacy on public networks.

## Privacy-Focused Alternatives to Apple Apps
Consider using privacy-centric alternatives to native Apple apps, such as:
- Safari → Brave (see iOS browser comparison [here](https://privacytests.org/ios))
- iMessage → Signal
- iCloud → Proton Drive
- iCloud Keychain → Bitwarden
- Apple Calendar → Proton Calendar
- iCloud Private Relay (VPN) -> Proton VPN
- Apple Mail -> Proton Mail
- Apple Notes -> Standard Notes
- iCloud Photos -> ente

and so on.

Each alternative is selected for its strong focus on user privacy and security features, like end-to-end encryption.

## Siri Privacy Settings
Manage Siri’s access under `Settings → Siri & Search` for better privacy. Consider disabling 'Listen for “Hey Siri”' to minimize data sharing.

## Securing iCloud Settings
Regularly review your iCloud settings. Enable two-factor authentication and use end-to-end encryption where possible.

## Safari Privacy and Security Settings
Enhance your privacy in Safari by enabling Fraudulent Website Warnings and managing cookies effectively. Consider disabling JavaScript for added security.

## Staying Secure with iOS Updates
Regularly update your iOS to the latest version to benefit from the newest security patches. Keep your apps updated as well.

## Physical Security Measures for Your Device
Never leave your device unattended in public places. Use features like Find My iPhone for theft recovery.

## The Risks of Jailbreaking
Jailbreaking exposes your device to additional security risks. It's generally advised to avoid jailbreaking for maintaining device security.

## Secure Backups
Always use encrypted backups and regularly test backup restores to ensure data integrity.

## Screen Time & Restrictions for Added Security
Use Screen Time to enforce content and privacy restrictions, preventing unauthorized changes to your device settings. This is particularly useful if someone learns your device passcode.

## Optimizing System Services for Privacy
Fine-tune `Settings → Privacy & Security → Location Services → System Services`. Turn off non-essential services like `Location-Based Apple Ads` and `Significant Locations` to minimize location data collection.

## Understanding and Using Lockdown Mode
Lockdown Mode is designed for users at high risk of targeted cyber attacks. It limits certain functionalities to reduce the device's attack surface. Activate it under `Settings → Privacy & Security → Lockdown Mode`, but be aware that it will restrict many standard features.

## Purchasing iOS Devices Anonymously
For anonymity, purchase iOS devices with cash at physical stores and avoid any setup or registration offered in-store.

## Initial Setup and Apple ID: Best Practices
Start with a new or factory reset device. Set up your Apple ID away from personal networks and use non-personal information for the account.

## Advanced Location Services and Tracking: Disabling for Privacy
During the initial setup, disable all connectivity options like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular data. Post-setup, regularly verify these settings, especially after updates.

## Detailed Privacy Settings Adjustments
Limit Siri's access and turn off notifications for sensitive apps. In Safari, use private browsing and disable suggestions—opt-out of analytics data sharing for enhanced privacy.

## Managing Emergency Alerts and Addressing False Privacy Warnings
Understand that some government alerts may bypass your settings. Verify your settings if iOS flags a privacy warning due to DNS changes. Often, these can be dismissed for secure DNS setups.

## VPN and DNS Configurations for Enhanced Privacy
Choose a privacy-respecting VPN provider and configure it not to log your data. Use DNS services for additional filtering and privacy.

## Choosing the Right Device: Device Selection and Biometric Security
Select devices with features that meet your security needs. Understand the legal and security implications of biometric features like Touch ID and Face ID.

## Alternatives to Data Transfer and iCloud
Explore secure cloud services like Proton Drive and prefer physical data transfers (like USB) over wireless ones for sensitive data.
