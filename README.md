## Introduction
Welcome to the Ultimate iOS Hardening Guide! This comprehensive guide is designed for users of all levels – from beginners to advanced – aiming to enhance the security and privacy of iPhones and iPads. While primarily focused on iOS, much of this guide is also applicable to iPadOS. We explore Apple's security features, address their limitations, and present alternative solutions for robust privacy and security in the Apple ecosystem.

## Passcodes and Encryption
- **Strong Passcode**: Opt for a passcode with at least 6 digits. Consider using an alphanumeric passcode for higher security.
- **Biometric Security**: Use Face ID or Touch ID, keeping in mind the legal and privacy implications.
- **Advanced Options**: Disable 'Simple Passcode' to use complex passcodes.
- **Data Protection**: Enable data protection and keychain protection in your device settings.

## Two-Factor Authentication
Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security. It requires something you know (your password) and something you have (your device). To enable 2FA, go to `Settings → [Your name] → Password & Security → Two-factor authentication`.

## Tracking and Location Services
For privacy, manage your location services and tracking settings. Go to `Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking` and toggle off the 'Allow Apps to Request to Track' option. Regularly review app permissions for location access in `Settings → Location Services`.

## Biometric ID Considerations
Biometric identifiers like Touch ID and Face ID are convenient but have legal implications. In some jurisdictions, using a passcode offers more legal protection than biometrics.

## Lock Screen Security
Limit what's accessible from your lock screen to protect personal information. Go to `Settings → Touch ID/Face ID & Passcode` and manage what apps and features are available when your phone is locked.

## App Permissions
Regularly review and manage app permissions in your device settings. Be cautious with permissions for microphone, camera, and location access.

## Disable Tracking and Ad Tracking
To limit ad tracking, go to `Settings → Privacy & Security → Apple Advertising` and toggle off the 'Personalized Ads' option.

## VPN and Firewall
Use a VPN for enhanced privacy and security. A VPN protects against Wi-Fi hacking and hides your IP address.


## Alternatives to Apple Apps

Replacing Apple's native apps with privacy-focused alternatives can significantly enhance your data privacy and security. Here’s a list of alternatives for common Apple apps:

- **iCloud Keychain** -> **Bitwarden**
- **Safari** -> **Brave**  
  Check out [iOS browser comparison](https://privacytests.org/ios) for more details.
- **iMessage** -> **Signal**
- **iCloud (Cloud Storage)** -> **Proton Drive**
- **iCloud Private Relay (VPN)** -> **Proton VPN, Mullvad VPN, IVPN**
- **Apple Calendar** -> **Proton Calendar**
- **Apple Mail** -> **Proton Mail**
- **Apple Notes** -> **Standard Notes**
- **iCloud Photos** -> **ente**

Each of these alternatives has been chosen for their strong focus on user privacy and security, offering features like end-to-end encryption and minimal data collection.

## Siri Privacy Settings
For better privacy, manage Siri’s access in `Settings → Siri & Search`. Limit the apps Siri can access and consider turning off 'Listen for “Hey Siri”' to reduce data sharing with Apple.

## iCloud Settings
Review your iCloud settings and manage which apps can synchronize data. Enable two-factor authentication and use end-to-end encryption where possible.

## Safari Settings
In Safari, enable Fraudulent Website Warnings and consider disabling JavaScript for enhanced security. Manage website data and cookies effectively in Safari settings.

## iOS Updates
Keep your iOS version updated for the latest security patches. Regularly update your apps as well.

## Physical Security Measures
Never leave your device unattended in public. Use features like Find My iPhone for theft recovery.

## Jailbreaking
Jailbreaking can expose your device to additional security risks. Weigh the risks versus benefits and generally avoid jailbreaking for security reasons.

## Backups
Use encrypted backups. Regularly test backup restores to ensure data integrity.

## Malware Protection
Be vigilant against malware. Install reputable anti-malware applications and keep your device updated. Stay informed about new threats and regularly visit websites tracking iOS malware.
